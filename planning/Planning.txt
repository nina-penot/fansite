Other:

-Website should have an omnipresent audio track playing smooth jazz night version of Waluigi Pinball
-Should have a very "neon city at night" aesthetic, with street tags
-May have something to do with Pinball
-Ideally the stat height should have a Waluigi behind a doorframe next to the silhouette of 175cm tall person.
-Main page has video of Waluigi being cool (tennis aces power showcase)
-Or maybe a background gif/video of Waluigi doing cool things
-favicon should be Waluigi's L
-Would be very cool (although hard) if the history page had a new nav menu, vertical, that sticks to the page
and allows quick access to each section of the history (like a wiki menu that)
